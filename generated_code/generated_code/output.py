Below is the combined Python script based on the provided subtask:

```python
print('Hello, World!')
```

This is a very simple script that adheres to Python best practices. It prints 'Hello, World!' to the console when executed. The complexity level is indeed 1/5 as it's a basic print statement which is typically the first command learned in Python.

You can run this script by saving it in a .py file and running that file with a Python interpreter, or directly in a Python shell.
